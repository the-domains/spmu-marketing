**Marketing your Semi Permanent Makeup Business.**

This little blog has been set up to offer UK Semi permanent Makeup technicians some tips and tricks when it comes to marketing themselves and their business.

It'll be run and updated by me, Rich Fletcher, the person that runs the Dermace.co.uk website. All the help and advice I post is free, and if you have questions you're more than welcome to get in touch. This is a resource for all technicians to take advantage of - and while I work for Dermace, the information I post will be applicable for anyone wanting to work on their online presence.

So, I'll be aiming to post up to the blog once a week or so. It may be more frequent, it may slip sometimes....check back from time to time and you'll be able to follow the tips as we go.

Thanks for reading.

Rich.
